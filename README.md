# **CHADOWN**
## The Basics
CHADOWN is my C# rewrite of my shell script [SHADOWN](https://github.com/Jabarabo/SHADOWN). The point is so this can be run on windows unlike SHADOWN which was *NIX exclusive. All files are currently output into the user's Videos folder. This can now be changed in the program's main menu.

## Requirements
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

## Operational Instructions
**Youtube-DL**: Youtube-DL option is pretty easy to use. Follow the on screen instruction. If you need to know which sites you can use this on look [here](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html).

**BLOB/M3U8**: This option hinges on you knowing how .m3u8 files work and how to retieve them from a streaming site's page. Once you find the file copy and paste the URL for it when it asks and follow the onscreen instructions.

**Merge Audio/Video**: If you have a stubborn website that won't work with Youtube-DL and splits the audio and video streams, use this option. Download the individual streams and use this option to piece them together without all the hassle of opening your *totally legitimate* video editing software.
